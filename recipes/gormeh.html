    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>
      Ghormeh sabzi is hands down my favorite Persian stew! For anyone that
      hasn’t tried Persian food before, this is a great introduction to one of
      the many stews that you will find in the cuisine. Ghormeh sabzi showcases
      a lot of traditional Persian flavors, from the fragrant fresh herbs, to
      the fatty, savory lamb shank, and finally the punch of tart lemon that
      delights the tastebuds.I cannot recommend this dish enough and it is
      certainly worth the time you put into it. What’s nice about this dish is
      there are several steps that can be done over the course of the day and it
      does not require constant attention in the kitchen. The recipe below
      serves 5-6 people, please let me know how this goes for you and what you
      think!
